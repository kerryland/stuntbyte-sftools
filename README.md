# Welcome to Stuntbyte!

We provide tools to help Salesforce Developers work more productively with the [salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/) and [database.com](http://www.database.com/) platforms.

*   **Stuntbyte JDBC** - Our JDBC driver for Salesforce. It makes querying and updating Salesforce simple, and allows the use of best-of-breed database query tools. It also helps with data migration and reporting.
    * [Introduction] (docs/jdbc-driver/index.md)
    * [Configuration] (docs/jdbc-driver/jdbc-configuration.md)
    * [Supported SQL] (docs/jdbc-driver/sql.md)
*   **[Stuntbyte Deploy](docs/deployment-tool.md)** - Our deployment tool for Salesforce. It takes away much of the pain of Salesforce deployments.
*   **[Stuntbyte IDE](docs/ide.md)** - Our replacement for the "Force IDE". It lets developers use quality editors like Sublime Text 2 and VIM to compile, test, and navigate Salesforce Apex code.
