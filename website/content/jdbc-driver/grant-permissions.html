title: Grant Permissions
---

<p>The JDBC driver can set profile permissions, although these currently cannot be embedded within the deployment script and must be run directly against the destination environment. It does save a lot of pointing and clicking.</p>
<p>But first, a disclaimer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">WARNING: DO NOT RUN THESE COMMANDS AGAINST A PRODUCTION INSTANCE OF SALESFORCE IF YOU HAVE MANY APEX UNIT TESTS.</p>
<p>This is because each GRANT or REVOKE command is currently an independent "deployment" from Salesforce's perspective, so if run against a Production instance then ALL TESTS will be run for EACH command. If you have a lot of Apex unit tests this may end up taking a very, very, long time. One day this functionality will be rolled into the Deployment Tool, if there is sufficient demand.</p>
<p>Permissions can be granted, or revoked at an object level:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
GRANT OBJECT [create],[update],[delete],[read]
 ON &lt;object&gt; TO [&lt;Profile Name&gt; | * ]
 
 REVOKE OBJECT [create],[update],[delete],[read] 
 ON &lt;object&gt; FROM [&lt;Profile Name&gt; | * ]
</code></pre>
or at field level:

<pre><code class="language-sql">
GRANT FIELD [ VISIBLE], [EDITABLE]
 ON &lt;object&gt;.[&lt;field&gt;|*] TO [&lt;Profile Name&gt; | * ]

REVOKE FIELD VISIBLE ON &lt;object&gt;.[&lt;field&gt;|*] FROM [&lt;Profile Name&gt; | * ]
</code></pre>

<p>WARNING: The GRANT and REVOKE commands are likely to fail with a profile of "*" as it will probably attempt to modify a readonly profile, and so fail.</p>
