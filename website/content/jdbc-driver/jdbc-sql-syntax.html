title: JDBC SQL DML Syntax
---
<p>Here are the SQL DML commands we currently support:</p>
<h2>UPDATE</h2>
<p>A normal SQL UPDATE statement, including support for expressions that refer to other columns:</p>

<pre><code class="language-sql">
UPDATE Lead 
   SET firstName = firstname + ' ' + lastname, 
       NumberOfEmployees=NumberOfEmployees*2*annualRevenue
 WHERE annualRevenue > 0
</code></pre>

<p></p>
<h2>INSERT</h2>
<pre><code class="language-sql">
<p>A normal SQL INSERT statement:</p>
INSERT INTO Account(name, billingCity)
VALUES ('Mr Jones', 'Super City')
</code></pre>

<p></p>
<h2>DELETE</h2>
<p>A normal SQL DELETE statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">
DELETE FROM account
WHERE billingCity = 'Super City'
</code></pre>

<p></p>
<h2>SELECT</h2>
<p>SELECT behaves as per Salesforce <a href="http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_calls_soql_select.htm">SOQL</a>, with the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for "SELECT *". This is almost priceless!</li>
<li>Support for column aliases via "as"</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-sql">
SELECT FirstName as fn, LastName as ln, CreatedBy.name as cn
FROM Lead
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Support for "count(*)", as well as Salesforce-native "count()" and "count(id)".</li>
<li>Patches illegal SOQL to valid SQL, ie: "WHERE ID = null" to "WHERE 0 = 1".</li>
</ul>

<h2>SELECT non-features</h2>
<p>We haven't rewritten the Salesforce SQL engine, and still inherit the other Salesforce-supplied SOQL SELECT limitations, including no support for normal SQL joins.</p>
<p>We also don't support SOQL's nested SELECT functionality, because it doesn't really fit into the relational model. eg:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">
SELECT Account.Name, Type,
(SELECT b.LastName FROM Account.Contacts b)
FROM Account
</code></pre>

<p></p>
<h2>Data Type Literals</h2>
<p>When using string literals in commands please adhere to the following formats:</p>
<table border="1">
<tbody>
<tr><th>DataType</th><th>Format</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>DateTime</td>
<td>yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSS'Z'</td>
<td>2010-10-21T23:15:00.000Z</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Date</td>
<td>yyyy-MM-dd</td>
<td>2012-12-31</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>MultiPickList</td>
<td>semi-colon-delimited values</td>
<td>Red;Blue;Green</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p></p>
<h2>General Limitations</h2>
<p>UPDATE, DELETE and SELECT all depend on the SOQL WHERE clause, so they inherit the limitations provided by Salesforce. In particular you cannot write a WHERE clause that compares one column to another, eg:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sql">
SELECT * FROM Lead
WHERE LastActivityDate = ConvertedDate
</code></pre>
