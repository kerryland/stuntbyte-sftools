title: JDBC Limitations
---

<p>Although the JDBC Driver doesn't offer every piece of JDBC functionality, it does support less-obvious features such as batch updates, and updateable result sets.</p>
<p>The major unsupported feature is currently scroll cursors.</p>
<p>Anything that isn't supported will generally throw a SQLFeatureNotSupportedException, so it should be obvious when you have pushed the current version too far. If there's particular functionality you need, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>.</p>
