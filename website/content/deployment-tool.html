title: Deployment Tool
---
<p>The Stunt Byte Salesforce Deployment Tool is a text-based tool that helps with migration of Salesforce components between instances of Salesforce.</p>
<p>It's especially helpful if you use separate development, test and productions instances of Salesforce -- like you know you should.</p>
<p>Essentially the tool is a simpler and/or more flexible way to achieve the same thing that Salesforce provide via <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/help/doc/en/code_tools_ant.htm">the ant tool</a>, Eclipse's "Deploy to Server" feature, or the web-based deployment tool, except it's better because:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can easily merge deployment scripts made by multiple developers</li>
<li>You can easily "tweak" deployments prior to deployment</li>
<li>You don't have to XML yourself to death with the ant tool</li>
<li>You don't have to point and click yourself to death with the Eclipse tool, or the web-based tool</li>
<li>It actually works (unlike the web-based tool)</li>
</ul>
Try it out!
