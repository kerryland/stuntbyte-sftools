WHO:
----
Some guy in New Zealand who got fed up.


WHAT:
-----
"Farce IDE" is an alternative to Salesforce's "Force IDE". The difference is that
"Farce IDE" supports:

- Keyboard navigation through classes and methods.
- Decent error messages, and an IDE that takes you to the offending line
  of the correct class.
- A debug log file that you can search through.
- Confidence that you know when a file has been saved to the server.
  No more waiting for the "successful save flicker" before you run a test.


WHY:
----
"The Force.com IDE is a powerful client application for creating, modifying,
 testing and deploying Force.com applications"

(http://wiki.developerforce.com/index.php/Force.com_IDE)

Snigger.

The Force.com IDE is a stinking pile of poo that Salesforce should be
ashamed of.


WHEN:
-----
Farce.IDE was thrown together one Sunday in early February 2011.


HOW: (ie: INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS)
----
Via a combination of the VIM editor, CTAGS, and Salesforce's "Apex" API.
